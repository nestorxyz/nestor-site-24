# About Nestor Mamani

## Who is Nestor?

Nestor Mamani is a builder and software engineer based in Lima, Peru. He's a former industrial engineer who found more enjoyment in shipping products than in traditional engineering work.

## Background Story

Nestor started coding in 2020 while studying industrial engineering at the National Major University of San Marcos. His tech journey began with a DIY 3D printer in 2019 that ended up frying the Arduino, but he learned to love the process of building things.

That curiosity led him to ship products at YC and 500 Global startups, moving from cloning UIs to architecting complex AI agents. Now, he's building Kubo (an AI accounting platform at holakubo.com) and exploring the intersection of finance and autonomous software.
